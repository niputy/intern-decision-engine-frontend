# Conclusion

## Front-end side

1. App is lagging when you try to move slider very fast due to multiple requests. You can use onChangeEnd method to fix it.
2. Minimum months number should be 12 instead of 6.
3. I suppose we can clean up sliders by add slider to separate widget.
4. Clean up _submitForm function

## Back-end side

calculateApprovedLoan function need a clean up and creditModifier may be inside of the functions.
